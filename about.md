Hi, I'm Hana, a junior in high school. Welcome to my personal blog!

I am currently slowly but surely teaching myself web development, starting with the creation of this blog. This site will be under a lot of construction for a while. Teaching myself web development is just one step in my goal to learn as much as I can about development and programming on my own while I'm still in high school.

This blog was built from scratch using Github, Jekyll, and an existing CSS template. (Not to mention the countless tutorials, documentations, and Stack Overflow forums I've read.) I plan to continue customizing the layout and CSS of this blog.

I tried keeping blogs before using sites like WordPress, Tumblr, and Blogger, but none of them appealed to me the way that self-hosting with Jekyll and Github has. I always love a challenge, and making my own blog and website from scratch appeals greatly to my inner (and outer?) nerd.

Thank you for visiting my blog!
